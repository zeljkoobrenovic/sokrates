# Release notes

User-visible behaviour changes, newest first. `:latest` of the Docker image and the `master` branch carry
everything listed under the most recent date.

### Path patterns match the path below the source root (behaviour change)

A filter's `pathPattern` — in `ignore`, the scope rules (`test`, `generated`, `buildAndDeployment`,
`other`), logical decomposition filters and concerns — is now matched against the file's path **below
the source root, with a leading `/`**: `/src/app/service.py`. Before, it was matched against the whole
path as Sokrates loaded it, source root included.

Why: with an absolute source root (Docker's `/code`, any absolute `-srcRoot`, or a configuration file
given by an absolute path) the folders *above* the repository were part of every match. A repository
checked out under a `tests`, `docs`, `build` or `generated` folder had all its files classified by that
folder's name, and an `ignore` rule such as `.*/docs/.*` could silently empty the analysis.

What stays the same: every pattern written the documented way, starting with `.*` and naming folders
inside the repository (`.*/[Tt]ests/.*`, `.*[.]sql`, `.*/src/main/.*`), matches exactly as before,
including on top-level folders thanks to the leading `/`.

What to check: a pattern that deliberately named a folder above the repository — for example
`.*/code/src/.*` written against Docker's `/code` — no longer matches; drop the prefix
(`.*/src/.*`). Folder-depth components are unaffected (their generated filters start at the folder
now). The `sokrates-skills` configuration scripts (`preview_config.py` and the proposal scripts) follow
the new rule from the same date.

### The analysis output is always ignored

`init` writes the ignore rules for `_sokrates/`, `_sokrates_landscape/`, the git export text files and
`sokrates_*.json` into every new `config.json`, also when nothing matches them yet (on a first analysis
the output does not exist). Configurations written earlier get the same rules in memory when
`generateReports` loads them; the file itself is not modified. Before, a second run of a fresh
configuration counted the first run's reports as main code.

### `generateReports -confFile _sokrates/config.json` analyzes the repository

A configuration file given by a relative path with no grandparent (`_sokrates/config.json` run from the
repository root) resolved the default `srcRoot` `..` against the working directory's parent and analyzed
that folder. It now resolves to the repository, and the resolved root stays relative when the
configuration path is relative.
